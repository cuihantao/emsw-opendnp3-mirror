opendnp3 (1.2.4-0sentient0) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add new ScanScheduler class to allow trigger on-demand integrity poll.
  * Fix bug in waiting for stop in ThreadBoost that cuases a double free of
    the thread pointer.
  * Fix exceptions thrown in TestMaster due to changes in the previous
    release. The command task is now marked as an online task and is properly
    disabled instead of relying on a OnComplete callback.
  * Fix race condition in stopping and deallocating the VTO router that could
    cause an invalid memory access because the router was not de-registered
    from the VtoReader instance.

opendnp3 (1.2.3-0sentient0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix unhandled exception case where LinkLayerRouter is performing
    AsyncWrite() while the physical layer is closing by checking with
    CanWrite().
  * Fix bug in master stack state where if the lower layer goes down while a
    task is being executed, the task never gets the proper OnComplete()
    call. The result is that the task remains in running mode indefinitely
    and no other tasks can be started leaving the master in a hung state.

opendnp3 (1.2.2-0sentient0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed on read-write failure handling such that the socket is suspended
    instead of being shutdown. If the socket is shutdown, it can't be
    reused until the stack is restarted.
  * Fixed VTO remote state synchronization logic to prevent stalling of the
    VTO channel in the case of a duplicate open.

opendnp3 (1.2.1-0sentient0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added error handling for read/write error on an opened physical layer.
    The open retry timer is now properly respected when attempting to
    recover from a read/write error and not only on initial open
    attempts.

opendnp3 (1.2.0-0sentient0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Reduced VTO buffering to better reflect network performance
    to user apps.
  * Exposed the ability to configure the VtoWriterQueueSize for the Master.
  * Exposed the ability to configure the TCP send and receive buffer size.
  * Added the ability to clear the need time flag on the outstation through a
    IIN write.
  * Added UDP as a physical layer option.
  * Fixed bug that caused Binary Input Event (Gr2Var2) timestamp to always be
    0.

opendnp3 (1.1.3-0sentient0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed incorrect handling of socket open failure when an async
    open results in host name resolution failure.
